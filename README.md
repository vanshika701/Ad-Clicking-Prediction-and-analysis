# 📊 Advertisement Analysis & Sales Prediction

This project explores and analyzes advertisement data to understand the impact of different advertising media (TV, Radio, Newspaper) on product sales. Using a combination of **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **Machine Learning algorithms**, it aims to reveal insights and build predictive models for sales outcomes based on advertising budgets.

## 🧠 Features

- 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis with Seaborn and Matplotlib
- 📊 Visualizations of ad spend vs. sales trends
- 🧠 Classification using **Logistic Regression** to predict sales behavior
- 🧪 Model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report
- 🔍 Correlation analysis and feature encoding for categorical data
- 🛠️ Data cleaning, imputation, and preprocessing

## 🚧 Project Status

⚠️ **This project is currently a work in progress.**  
Further analysis, model experimentation, and feature additions are planned.

Upcoming additions:
- 🧠 More ML models (e.g., Decision Trees, XGBoost)
- 📊 Streamlit-based interactive dashboard
- 🧪 Cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning
- 📦 Deployment-ready structure
